## Dataset

> There are 113,937 loans in the dataset with 81 features of each loan including; loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income with most variables being numeric in nature. The aim of the exploration is to determine which of the features really affected the status of each loan. The features of interest in this exploration are Borrower's Annual Percentage Rate (APR), Borrower's interest rate for the loan and Term of loan.


## Summary of Findings

> To determine which features affect the outcome of loans, I analysed each feature and below is a summary some of the findings:  
More of the loans taken are those still running/ongoing, the borrower annual percentage rate plot is bimodal having two peaks and borrowers interest rates on loans are mostly between 0.13 and 0.16. Employed people borrow more and borrowers who are in the 'Other' category of occupation took more loans. However, more borrowers come from California(interestingly) and most of the borrowers pay back between 150 and 200 monthly as stated monthly income shows that more borrowers are in the monthly income range between 3800 and 4500. Furthermore, more medium term loans are taken compared to long term loans and more of the loans taken are very risky with scores 4 and 5 followed by less risky loans scored 6, 8 and 7. 

> More borrowers opted for medium term loans as it has more APRs and more borrowers took loans with low interest rates which translates to the low annual percentage rates and lower borrower interest rates are rated highly. Loans completed have an average annual percentage rate of 0.2- a low rate which I think made it easy to get the loans completed. Also, being an home owner does not affect the status of the loan as the number of borrowers who are home owners is higher than those who are not. The loans with prosper scores between 9 and 11 had the most recommendations that is, people prefer the least risky kinds of of loan, which is no surprise,  most people are really afraid of the risky loans as most of the recommendations were for the least risky loans. Finally, I think it is safe to say that Borrowers Annual Percentage Rates and Borrowers Interest Rates have effects loan status- howbeit little, since loan status(excluding completed ones) do not have low APRs.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> From the explorations made, I discovered that people prefer the least risky kind of loan because most of the recommendations made were for the least risky loans, which is no surprise.

> Medium term loans, which have high APRs were preferred to long term loans.

> Status of loans is not affected by the term taken because in all the categories of loan status medium term loans is high"# prosper_loan"
